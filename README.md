![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n3storm/Matrilineare/master/matrilineare__version_0_3__by_sora_meliae-preview.png)

This is an icon-theme maintained with Xfce in mind, but it 
supports other desktops like Gnome3 as well.

This repository holds Matrilineare version 3 from Deviant Art:
http://sora-meliae.deviantart.com/art/Matrilineare-version-0-3-321379531

Author is DeviantArt artist Sora-Meliae (Andrea Soragna).
She (or he) hasn't answer any question at her DeviantArt profile
since 2013 and I couldn't find her anywhere else on Internet,
so I decided to make a backup ot her great icon theme 
at Github.
